# Class 12 - RESTful Endpoints and External APIs

*The focus of this day is on reinforcing the underlying concepts of the REST architectural style and  how to interact with application resources through the use of the HTTP verbs.  Students will need to know how to use jQuery AJAX methods, plus manage keys or tokens as needed, to make GET requests to external public APIs.*

- Announcements
	- Project Week is coming! We'll have a quick discussion on project ideas TODAY *(like, right meow, 15 minutes tops)* so that we can get a sense of how to scope them.
		- Wednesday and Thursday we'll continue discussing project ideas and start generating a list of possible projects.
		- Friday we'll finalize project teams and get Project Week underway! Teams will be able to pick whatever project they want from the list, or propose a new one, as most of you experienced in 201 last month.
		- Sam will consider examining the possibilities of us doing our final class and review session on Friday morning so that we can go ahead and roll into project planning on Friday afternoon. It'll depend on room avaialability and also the will of the class.
	- Reminder: the entrance exam for the 401 courses (which doubles as the final exam for this course) will be published on Friday afternoon and be available until 11:59pm Sunday.
