# Portfolio Assignment for Class 5 - Code Review

This portfolio assignment is designed in the curriculum as a peer code review assignment, without any specific pieces to add. You are encouraged to go through this peer code review process, whether onliine over the weekend or on person on Monday person... but you are not required to do this due to the fact that this assignment was distributed late. We will do a peer code review with the portfolio later in Week 2.

So, in the meantime, keep building out your portfolio. If you'd like to have a page like our blog entry page, one that would actually store and persist data so that your portfolio could have an actual blog on it, you can build that out. Later in the course (Day 13, when we discuss deployment) we will talk about strategies for persistence and storage of a blog, but that will not ever become a requirement of your portfolio.
