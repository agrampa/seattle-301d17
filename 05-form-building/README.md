# Form Building Workshop

Today we'll add a new page to the blog app, and get it wired up during an in-class workshop. That will be done in lieu of a pair-programming assignment.

## Learning Objectives

* Recap the primary concepts discussed throughout the week.
    * Ask the students "What have you learned so far?"
    * Ask "What has been challenging?"
    * Ask "What has been helpful?"
* Work through a form-based inputs to build out a JSON string export of a new blog article.
* Implement 3rd party library integration for dynamic code highlighting and markdown creation.
