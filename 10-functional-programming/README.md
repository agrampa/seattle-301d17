### Functional Programming

# Code 301, Class 10: ***Functional Programming***

## Today's Plan

Song for the day: ["Atomic Dog"] by George Clinton, because sometimes you just need a fun Friday song to celebrate dogs (and cat shirts!). Added layer of fun is that this song was originally on an album called ["Computer Games"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Games_(album)) which was intended as futuristic funk back in 1982 when it was released. And there's even some AR in the video!
