## WHICH ASPECTS OF THE COURSE DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- I didn't find anything least helpful this week. It was difficult but it was all do-able.

- I cannot think of a part of this week that I did not find helpful. Each class seemed to build on top of each other in an order that makes a lot of sense.

- When we moved through new material extremely quickly, I found it difficult to understand topics conceptually.

- I didn't find anything we did this week "unhelpful"!

- The schedule confusion caused by the snow day.

- Everything was good.

- The slow code review. The starter code is crazy, so having Sam go over it, as tedious as it can be sometimes, makes a big difference

- I know this week was a little off because of the snow day, but I think the paired labs and portfolio assignments have been simpler while the in-class demos have been more complex. I wish there were a little more balance.

- I think we're getting into more complicated territory calling lots of js files and libraries but we've only covered how we organize and call our js briefly.

- Sometimes we spent a lot of time reviewing information from 201, I know it's helpful to review it but sometimes the time spent on it was excessive

- The snow day made this week super tight schedule wise. I'm not quite sure how I feel about afternoon lectures.

- The snow day was, obviously, a bit of a mess. But, also, the way Sam and the TA's have attempted to handle it has been difficult to track. A few people came in early, so Sam asked if we wanted a TA early, and then on Friday I was admonished that TAs don't start before 9AM... WAT?

- Our first assignment on Tuesday was _really_ tough; it felt like much of what we needed to know wasn't included in that day's instruction. However, I'm not sure if that's because we lost a day, or if that was intended to drive us to look things up more often.

- labtime

- I'm finding it very challenging getting adjusted to the workflow style. It seems we make a bunch of changes to the code, but not verifying many of these changes are along the way, until the end where we have a pile of errors. This was especially evident on Friday, where things "seemed" right. Sam is already familiar with this code, but I can't imagine writing code in this way without some kind of verification process for each TODO.

- Paired programming. Typically I love it, but with starter-code I prefer to get my bearing with what's happening in the code by going over it myself. With the pair-programming, we seem to gloss over how the code is set up, and jump right to figuring out how to complete the TODO's, which leaves me a little confused. If I had a chance to see the starter code before we get our partners, and look it over for a bit before we try to complete TODO's, I would probably get a lot more from it.

- The snow day made it a catch up week, and we had to power through a lot during a short amount of time.

- The in class code demos and code review.

- It was hard but most of the reasons have nothing to do with codefellows.

## WHICH ASPECTS OF THE COURSE DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- I found that the workshops where we went through the lab together was the most helpful and doing the peer work was a lot of fun and made things easier because we are able to help each other out and working together to get the work done.

- With our class missing one day this week, I found it very helpful to workshop through some of the labs. I am not sure we would have been able to work through all of the content necessary if we did not do that.

- Practicing new material three times (demo, lab, portfolio) was extremely helpful

- I appreciate (so much) that Sam is willing to go down rabbit holes to fully answer a student's question. I think when this happens during lecture, it really helps everyone out in some way or another.

- Being able to work on labs in the morning.

- Paired programming.

- It's been a weird weird week schedule wise. Kind of all over the place. I like having the time in the morning to work before lecture, but then we leave at 5-6 which is peak traffic time....also the Jon Duckett readings suck

- The lectures were really good. I also like that we're working on one on-going project - the portfolio - while layering on new tools and concepts to increase functionality.

- Workshopping the labs this week was very helpful! I'm relieved that we aren't behind from the snow day

- This in class/ workshopped lectures were super helpful.

- Sam, taking extra time to explain, not just the code, but also his thought process and an over-all means to understanding, which he has created, has been great.

- Completing the last couple of lab assignments as a class rather than breaking off into pairs was probably the most helpful, due to the time we lost from the snowstorm on Monday.

- lecture

- I think the general layout of having labs and project is great, I wish 201 could have been structured more this way. I also find Sam's explanations of concepts to be extremely useful and easy to remember. Today he drew a diagram and I felt like I understood what he tried to convey immediately.

- The code-demo's were very helpful. It's part code review, which helps me understand what each command is doing, and part lab, which lets me test things out without falling too far down any rabbit holes.

- Going through the labs during class time was helpful. I like how Sam tries to explain things as we go along, and doesn't rush past things if he's not sure that we understand.

- I think having a consistent idea about the course schedule would be helpful- I know there were some proposed changes but I am honestly not entirely sure what it is supposed to look like now.

- The instruction from Sam.

## DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- None at this time.

- None at this time.

- Please offer lockers for daily storage needs :)

- None

- Not at this time.

- I would rather have the lecture in the morning over afternoon; that's just my preference.

- Personally, it's difficult to sit in the dark classroom for 4-5 hours. I know the information is vital, but it's SO DARK. Is there a way to turn the lights on 50%?

- I think we do not have adequate TA coverage. In pair programming, my partner and I worked on a problem for fifteen minutes--like we were supposed to--and then we called for help. Nobody came. So we called again. In all, it took twenty five minutes for someone to come help us. By the time someone came, we were out of time and had to submit our incomplete code.

- Work a few extra days into the class schedules, so we aren't forced to have class on holidays and/or struggle to make-up snow days! This is something schools do, routinely. Having a few extra days on the schedule just makes good sense, and it would allow people more space to grade and re-submit, at the end of a class.

- None at this time.

- None atm

- None at this time.

- Not right now other than figuring out the schedule so that we can plan around it!
